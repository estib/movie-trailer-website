

Project Name: 

"Udacity_Project_1"


Use:

This project creates a locally hosted web-site that displays to a user 
6 movie titles along with their poster-images, trailers, IMDb profiles, 
and a link to a site by which the user might be able to purchase tickets 
to see these movies.


How to run:

Python should be installed. Some browser must be installed, and the user 
should be connected to the internet in order for the webpage to be used 
to its fullest extent. The "Udacity_Project_1" folder should be unzipped 
(you're reading this, so you've probably already done that) and the 
following three files should be included in the same folder directory:

1. fresh_tomatoes.py (will create webpage)
2. media.py (contains class for movies displayed on webpage)
3. entertainment_center.py (runs the actual program / makes everything 
happen)

Once these files are in the same folder, run the file 
"entertainment_center.py" and enjoy.


Author:

"fresh_tomatoes.py" was written by Udacity and slightly altered by 
Stephen Lechner. All other files were written by Stephen Lechner in 
order to complete a Udacity Nanodegree assignment.
